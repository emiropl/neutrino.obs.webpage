We'll be using Fullstack for practical purposes and development mainly of the landing page of Neutrino Observatory before making the application.

The Neutrino Observatory will be a real-time transit tracker for Human Design System, known as "The Program". Similar to a clock, we'll be able to track the movements of inner and outer planets as well.
